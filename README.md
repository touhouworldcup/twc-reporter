# twc-reporter

Reporting tool that creates summarized and translated digests of TWC committee channels for internal consumption. For each TWC committee discord channel:
- Create a log of recently sent messages, split into context log and report log
- Send this log to [Gemini 2.5 Pro](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/pro/) to be summarized
- Create translated "digests" for all other regions with an AI disclaimer, and send them out to other region's digest channels

## Request for public feedback

**THIS TOOL IS NOT CURRENTLY DEPLOYED.**

The TWC committee is requesting public feedback before deploying this tool. We recognize that AI is a controversial topic and integrating an AI summary/translation tool like this directly into our workflow could be seen negatively by the community.

Please use any of the following methods to write your comments/concerns:
- Google Form: https://forms.gle/4GNRq3urQJARyDWXA
- Email: twc-reporter-concerns@schwandes.de
- Discord: Join the [TWC 2025 server](https://discord.gg/uExtrbX2xZ) and use either the #role-assign channel to state your comments/concerns directly, or DM any @committee-en member.
