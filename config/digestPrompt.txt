Please now translate the summary you just generated to {{TARGET_LANGUAGE}}.
Add a header before the message in {{TARGET_LANGUAGE}}, saying:
"Here is a summary of what was discussed recently in the {{SOURCE_LANGUAGE}} Committee channel..."

Make sure to prefix the header with ### and translate it in {{TARGET_LANGUAGE}} as well.

If someone is mentioned by name (something is in double apostrophes), remember the following rules:
- Do not translate an English or Spanish into any other language, instead copy it verbatim.
- You may translate a Japanese or Chinese name into English or Spanish, but also state the original Japanese name.
- Do not translate a Chinese name into Japanese or vice versa.
- Remove the apostrophes around the name.

At the end of the summary, insert a footer in {{TARGET_LANGUAGE}} that the message is AI generated, and may contain mistakes.

If the content is already in {{TARGET_LANGUAGE}}, simply repeat the summary verbatim,
except with the header, footer, and following the name rules.
